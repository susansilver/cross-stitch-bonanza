Welcome to our second cross stitch bonanza where I discuss what I worked on this week. This concludes the month of August. I will also cover all the cross stith WIPs tha
I touched this month. At the end, I will discuss my plans for September.

## Cross Stitch WIPs

I only worked on two projects this past week. I'm trying to work more monogamously while still rotating through different pieces. This means, I might work on one
cross stitch for a week or even a month. I don't like choosing projects at random or only working on what interests me. Turns out, I want to see progress but I also want
to have a choice. This seems like the best approach that makes me happy. So, this week, I only worked on one cross stitch project.

### Stitchers Book Club

My main project was [Stitches Book Club from CloudsFactory](https://cloudsfactory.net/the-stitchers-book-club-cross-stitch-pattern.html). This is a SAL that I joined
rather late. I will not be able to catch up. I'm mostly done with the Stephen King section now. But, I'm unhappy with it. It is taking me forever and I'm excited
at the prospect of moving on. A bit of a slog but it will be worth it when it is done. I probably won't pick this one back up for awhile.

### Opening Gambit

I also continued to work on the [Long Dong Sampler, Opening Gambit](https://www.longdogsampler.com/product/opening-gambit/). This is a chess themed piece. This is a daily stitch where I add a strand or two at a time. This is
a smaller sampler at only around 20,000 stitches. It will take me a long time to finish, but it is doable at this pace. It is fun seeing all the small details appear.
I'm working on the castle currently.

## Cross Stitch Projects That I Worked On in August

In August, I completed 6,281 stitches! That is a new record for me. Typically, I only stitch about 5,000 in a month. It is my SALs that are contributing the most
to my stitch count. I would say, they account for at least 80% of all my cross stitching. These are the other projects that I worked on this month.

### Flower Meadow Dragon SAL

This is the [current SAL from Flossy Fox Shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4322334131/flower-dragon-meadow-stitch-along-6). You can still join. The next pattern drops on September 10th.

### Black Wing Haberdashery

This is a [pattern by Lindy Stitches](https://www.lindystitches.com/products/black-wing-haberdashery-cross-stitch-pattern-by-lindy-stitches?srsltid=AfmBOoo2qbw6kbksZNJHwPZAhZqX_LzjaXSAsE8Ay-UW9WzRoHQferDO). It features some blackbirds that attracted me to the pattern. i am completing this for the Stitchy SAL in the Catkin and Lillie
Patreon community.

## September Cross Stitch Plans

The plan is to continue with the SALs again this month and focus on completing those. I wanted to make a new start, but my package is currently missing. Hopefully it will
be found. And if not, that I'll be able to get a refund or replacement. The pattern is a [Dragons: A Field Guide by Climbing Goat Designs](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1513712264/dragons-a-field-guide-cross-stitch).
I got a [beautiful fabric from 123 stitch called Solar](https://123stitch.com/item/Picture-This-Plus-32-Ct-Solar-Belfast-Linen-18x26/PTP256). It looks like dragon fire to me and I think it is going to look awesome.

Other than that it is more stitching on Opening Gambit every day.

What are you working on?

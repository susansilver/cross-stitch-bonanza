On September 3<sup>rd</sup>, I made a start on Dargons: A Field Guide by Climbing Goats
Design. A former SAL, you can get the [completed pattern](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1513712264/dragons-a-field-guide-cross-stitch) now. I first
saw this one stitched by the [Lancashire Stitcher on Flosstube](https://www.youtube.com/@LancashireStitcher/videos). They do quite a few dragons and
it has totally enabled me.

Dragons: A Field Guide is special as it covers dragons from many cultures. The
pattern also has background information on each one. I think the most interesting to me
is FÃ¡fnir, who is the [inspiration for The Hobbit's dragon Smaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A1fnir).

In all honestly, I started this one out of panic and stress. The cross stitch hobby is one
that is taking the hurt from the tariffs. Many textiles come from other countries who will not ship
to the US until such time that they understand the new rules. So, I figured
that I should get the supplies now to start anything that I really wanted to start. At the top of my
list was Dragons: A Field Guide. I started it when I got the supplies because
my stress is through the roof. I like stitching dragons and I find it soothing at this time.

After one day of stitching, here is my start.

The fabric is Solar from Picture This Plus. I wanted it becaus
it looks like dragon fire. But, not understanding color theory this
could be a mistake. The bright background has muted the colors of the thread. The dragons
will not be as vibrant because of this. But, I'm going to stick with it for now. I think
the other issue is my camera and the light. The true color is not captured in this photo.
Much more blue in person. But, it is looking monochromatic gray here.

In total, I have completed 249 stitches. I am going to make
this my main stitching project for the month. Working on this, my two SALs, and my
long dog sampler. Those are the plans.

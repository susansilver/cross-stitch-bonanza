I feel like I'm artificially increasing my finish count by
working on small projects. But, it is nice to have
something completed. I'm rarely finishing anything right
now.

I've started tracking my pattern collection. This is because
most of them are digital PDFs. I have a ton of them and
they are organized on Google Drive by designer. That
doesn't tell me much about subject matter or size. I wanted
those things to be searchable. Because finding the folder is easy.
Knowing what is inside that folder is not.

I also purchased a USB drive. I'm always afraid that having
my patterns in the cloud isn't enough. They could get wiped if I lose my Google Account.
A USB is one more place to back things up.
It is also to store things like pictures and files from my Chromebook.
This is in case mhy computer dies; That way, I will not lose anything and
can transfer files to a new computer.

Now on to the projects!

## Finishes

I have two finishes this week. They are both small. Only a few
hundred stitches.

### Splish Splash

This is a [free pattern from Infinity Bear Designs](https://www.infinitybeardesigns.com/freebies?page=2&item=SplishSplash). It features
a cat in oversized rain boots who is singing and splashing in the rain.

There is a story behind this project. I live with my mom who
has had two strokes. I am her full-time caretaker. I received some
hand-dyed fabric that included a sample of an orange opalescent aida. My
mom fell in love with that sample. I then had to search
my patterns for something small enough to fit. I then worked
on it when I was spending time with my mom. It is a good memory.

I'm planning on continuing this as a tradition. Where I work
on a project while visiting mom. I'm going to keep them small.
So they don't took too long to stitch up and don't require a lot
of concentration.

### Smol Moth

This pattern was a freebie for the [BAD Stitch Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/badstitch). Unfortunately,
this pattern is no longer available. I recommend if you have the money to
sign up for the Patreon of your favorite cross stitch designer. It is about as
much as you would pay for a single chart and you get patterns that usually aren't released
to the public. I have a few more charts that I will be stitching in the future.

I turned the little one into a needle minder. I did this by stitching it on perforated paper. I then attached
a piece of felt with adhesive to the back. I used a pencil to outline the shape that I wanted to cut
cut around my smol moth. I used precision scissors to cut along the outlie that I made. I then
attached a magnet to the back of the moth using E6000.

It is simple too do and you could convert any small cross stitch design
to a needle minder. It is so lovely to know that I can make anything this way.

This project was inspired by [Stitching with Charlie](https://www.youtube.com/@stitchingwithcharlie) who makes her own magnets.

Kat of Catkin and Lillie is doing a [series of tutorials on perforated paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFclC0RdjY).

## WIPs

### Floral Meadow Dragon SAL

I only have one WIP this week. That is the Floral Meadow Dragon SAL from Flossy Fox Shop.
My intention was to have it finished by Sunday but that didn't happen. I'm
expecting it to take two or three more days to complete. I will be done
before the next part drops. I've completed the dragon and I'm working on the meadow bits.

## Haul

I purchased one pattern this week. Talking abut Patreon, this chart was originally
from [The Witchy Stitcher there](https://www.patreon.com/cw/thewitchystitcher). I
missed it. Only learning about it later from a person on Flosstube who is working on it. This month
it was released to the public and you can get a [digital copy from The Witchy Stitcher website](https://www.thewitchystitcher.com/product-page/a-graveyard-wander-pdf-pattern). It is called,"A Graveyard wander."
It features two bird people strolling through a graveyard at night.

## Plans

Well, most obviously, I am going to complete the Floral Meadow Dragon SAL part two. That
is the purple Wisteria dragon that you see in the picture above.

I am also planning on two new starts.

As my Halloween start, I am going to be working on [Gothic Bat by Yasmin's Made with Love](https://123stitch.com/item/Yasmins-Made-With-Love-Gothic-Bat-Halloween-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/YMWL-0010). I'm
stitching it with white Anchor floss. The fabric is 32 Count Lugana in [Vampire Kiss by BeStichMe](https://www.bestitchme.com/products/vampire-kiss?srsltid=AfmBOoq294wwh4odhIMJmNI7ImuYpeX6COZNyI0Eb9YAmuDiAp29uZvs).

My other new start is called Snail and Froggo Friend which I also got
from the [BAD Stitch Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/badstitch). it
is my next small project to work on while hanging with my mom.

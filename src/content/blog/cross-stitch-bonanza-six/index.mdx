I haven't been switching among projects right now. Choosing
to work on one at a time. Which means many things are on pause right now.
My focus is finishing the Flossy Fox Shop SAL before October 10<sup>th</sup>.
That is when the next part drops. We are heading now into the last
week of September and into Spooky month. I will have at least one new start next month.

## WIPs

Only two projects were worked on this week.

### Floral Dragon Meadow SAL

I started part two of the [Flossy Fox Shop Floral Dragon Meadow SAL](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4322334131/flower-dragon-meadow-stitch-along-6).
This section is the Wisteria Dragon. As you can imagine, lots of purple shades in this one. I mostly enjoy
the neck of this one. It stands out and it was fun to stitch. I've completed over
1,600 stitches. It is over 40% completed. My goal is to get
it done in a total of two weeks. But, I'm not on target. I might get close
if I can do 300 stitches a day.

I've almost completed all of the DMC 209 stitches. So, I think to finish the dragon that I will
do it by colors. It is nice to see zeros in cross stitch. After that it will only be the meadow
elements left.

This is my progress for the first week.

### Splish Splash by Infinity Bear Designs

So, when I bought fabric from Witch's Garden Crafts they came with some free samples.
Included in that was a scrap of 14 count orange opalescent aida. My mom saw this
and wanted me to stich something for her. Now this scrap is 3.5 inches by 4 inches. Finding
a pattern that would fit was difficult. All a little too large. But, I stumbled upoon
some free patterns from Infinity Bear Designs. I ended up going [with one
named "Splish Splash"](https://www.infinitybeardesigns.com/freebies?page=2&item=SplishSplash) that is 40 x 40 stitches. Which fits with some pretty small margins.
But it will fit.

I work on this project while visiting my mother. She has had two strokes and I'm her full time caretaker. I often
have to sit with her at meal times. that is when I take this out to work on.

## Haul

I'm only going to link to my most recent pattern purchases. I'm planning on doing
an extra where I post images of all my paper patterns. I'm not sure that I'm gong to do this with my digital patterns.
I have way too many PDFs. Though, I might show off a few that I have by designer. If
people are at all interested.

These are three new patterns which I purchases after seeing them on Flosstube.

### Cat Tier by Erin Elizabeth

This is a [cute tier of cats](https://123stitch.com/item/Erin-Elizabeth-Cat-Tier-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/EED-CATTIER) in interesting poses. They are different colors participating
in different activities. I love cats and this one caught my eye. It is also small and wouldn't
take long to stitch.

### Posh Strawberry Picnic by Artful Offerings

This is a cute [cross stitch of some fancy birds about to feast
on a strawberry](https://123stitch.com/item/Artful-Offerings-Posh-Strawberry-Picnic-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/23-2187). The
birds sold me on this one. The strawberry fascinator sells the poshness of the scene.
I also like stitching strawberries so this was a must have.

### Stench Stack by Plum Street Samplers

This is [a cute pile of skunks](https://123stitch.com/item/Plum-Street-Samplers-Stench-Stack-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/PSS-101) with a background of flowers.
it is a cute animal being adorable. There are a couple of patterns like this that I want to get. But, this is the first
one that I'm adding to my collection.

## Plans

The plan is to continue with the two projects featured here. Next week is the start of October.
The next project to work on is my Black Wing Haberdashery for the anything stitchy SAL in
the Catkin and Lillie Patreon community. I'll be moving on to the first half of the left bird. I might stitch
the full bird if it doesn't take more than a week to complete.

I also want to start two new projects next month. It seems likely that I will do
[Gothic Bat by Yasmin's Made With Love](https://123stitch.com/item/Yasmins-Made-With-Love-Gothic-Bat-Halloween-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/YMWL-0010). My fabric
will be [32 count Vampire Kiss](https://www.bestitchme.com/products/vampire-kiss?srsltid=AfmBOopnfatzMLQEk0LuFvKGtEYQhftAXOM6fSzFKdZugnKyqm57DiNX) by BeStitchMe.
I am also trying out Anchor floss in white. Just to see how I like it.

The other pattern that I want to start is a freebie from [The Stitch Crypt Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/thestitchcrypt). It is called Tea Reading Frog. I'm
not sure if it is still available. This probably won't happen as I already have too many projects. So, I might delay this to a
later date.

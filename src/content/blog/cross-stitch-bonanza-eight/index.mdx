There isn't much to report on this week. The biggest
issue of the week is some anger over how my pharmacy
is handling my medications. I'm having
difficulty getting my meds filled over things that
weren't a problem last month. Cannot do anything about it
until Monday at the earliest. Contacted all my doctors
to try to get it fixed but it is taking time. I was feeling
a bit run down this week and didn't get much stitching done. But,
I managed a finish and a start.

## Finish

I completed part two of the [Floral Dragon Meadow SAL by Flossy Fox Shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4322334131/flower-dragon-meadow-stitch-along-6). The
third part dropped on Friday and it is adorable. They went in a bit of a different direction
for the sunflower dragon which is blue with some yellow flowers. I'm going to Start
stitching on it near the end of the month. Here is the finish for now.

## Start

I've completed less than 500 stitches on my [Gothic Bat by Yasmin's Made With Love](https://123stitch.com/item/Yasmins-Made-With-Love-Gothic-Bat-Halloween-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/YMWL-0010).
It is some what disappointing not to have done more but this week was difficult. Hopefully, my meds get sorted out
soon and I'll return to my regular energy levels. Here is my start.

## Haul

Not much of a haul, picked up two patterns from Lola Crow.

[Greenhouse of Oddities](https://lolacrowcrossstitch.com/products/greenhouse-of-oddities-sal)

This is the only SAL that I've wanted. it mostly has to do with subject matter. They are all beautiful, but
this is the one that I want to stitch the most. I love that it has a corpse flower. How often are you going to get
to stitch a corpse flower. I am looking forward to starting this one soon.

[What the Cat Saw: Flight of Dragons](https://lolacrowcrossstitch.com/products/cross-stitch-pattern-cat-and-dragon-pdf-instant-download)

This is a series that Lola Crow does with cats in windows staring at a scene. I had to get the dragon. I don't
know when I'll get around to this one. But, I'm happy to add it to the dragon hoard.

## Plans

I'm not sure if I'm going to continue working on gothic bat. I was hyped to stat but feeling
less enthusiastic. The supplies came in for Graveyard Wander and I might move my attention to that. The plan is to
work on part three of the floral dragon meadow SAL at the end of the month. Then next month complete the first of
two bribs for the stitchy SAL in the Catkin and Lillie Patreon community.

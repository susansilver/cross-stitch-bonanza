Can't believe we are already on week three of updates! The focus
of the week was completing part three of the SAL that I'm doing
with the [Catkin and Lillie cross stitch community](https://www.patreon.com/c/catkinandlillie/posts).
I also had a new start this week, "Dragons: A Field Guide."

## New Starts

The big news from me is that I had a new start. I talked about this last week.
I wasn't expecting this one but my stress levels are high. I wanted
to stitch on more dragons to relax a little big more. As this
was a former Sal, I'm thinking that I might stitch a dragon a month. The [pattern is from
Climbing Goat Designs](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1513712264/dragons-a-field-guide-cross-stitch).

## WIPs

### Black Wing Haberdashery

I started this as part of the stitchy SAL. The idea is that
you stitch on a design that features embroidery. I chose [Black Wing Haberdashery](https://123stitch.com/item/Lindy-Stitches-Black-Wing-Haberdashery-Halloween-Cross-Stitch-Pattern/LS-089) by Lindy Stitches.
I am mostly attracted to the blackbirds featured in this design. That
will be the next bits now that I completed part three. Here is my
progress so far.

### Opening Gambit

I am continuing to work on [Opening Gambit](https://www.longdogsampler.com/product/opening-gambit/) by Long Dog Samplers.
This is my strand a day project. Slow but steady progress. The castle is starting to appear. I cannot wait to
complete it.

## Plans

No haul this week only plans. Soon, the new section for the
[Flossy Fox Shop SAL](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4322334131/flower-dragon-meadow-stitch-along-6) is going to drop. On September 10<sup>th</sup> It
should appear in my email. That will be my focus piece when it drops.

This is where I am currently at with it.

I will continue to work on Dragons: A Field Guide and Opening Gambit for the rest of the month.
